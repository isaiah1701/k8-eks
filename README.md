# EKS Cluster Deployment with GitOps, CI/CD, Security Scans, and Monitoring

## Overview  
This project delivers a production-ready EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) setup on AWS, emphasizing automation, security üîí, and observability üìä. It combines GitOps workflows, secure CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and full monitoring.

Key components include GitOps with ArgoCD üîÅ, Docker-based deployments to EKS üê≥, automated certificate and DNS management üåê, real-time monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana üìà, and fine-grained access control using RBAC üõ°Ô∏è. CI/CD pipelines are used to scan infrastructure and container images for security issues, build Docker images, and deploy applications to Kubernetes automatically.

This end-to-end setup reflects real-world production infrastructure aligned with modern DevOps best practices ‚úÖ.

# Why This Setup Adds Real Value in a Production Environment

ArgoCD for Reliable, Versioned Deployments  
ArgoCD enables consistent, auditable deployments directly from Git. It reduces manual errors, supports rollback, and fits cleanly into CI/CD workflows for team-based delivery.

EKS for Scalability and AWS Integration  
Using Amazon EKS provides a managed, production-grade Kubernetes environment. It handles scaling and availability out of the box, while integrating with other AWS services like IAM, VPC, and CloudWatch.

HTTPS and Access Control Built In  
Cert-Manager automates certificate management using Let‚Äôs Encrypt, removing the need for manual renewal or provisioning. RBAC is used to control access at both the namespace and cluster level.

CI/CD Pipelines with Security Checks  
Pipelines are set up to:
- Scan Terraform code with Checkov for misconfigurations  
- Build and push Docker images to ECR  
- Scan those images with Trivy before deployment  
- Deploy to EKS via Kubernetes manifests  
This approach helps catch security issues early and keeps deployments consistent.

Automated DNS with ExternalDNS  
ExternalDNS integrates with Route 53 to update DNS records automatically based on Kubernetes ingress changes. It removes the need for manual updates and speeds up deployments.

Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana  
Prometheus collects application and infrastructure metrics, and Grafana displays them in real-time dashboards. This makes it easier to track performance and catch issues before they impact users.
