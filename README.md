# üõ†Ô∏è EKS Cluster Deployment with ArgoCD, Helm Charts, Cert-Manager, and ExternalDNS with Prometheus and Grafana monitoring 

# Overview
This project focuses on deploying a production-grade EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster on AWS. It integrates essential Kubernetes tools like ArgoCD for GitOps, Helm Charts for app deployment, Cert-Manager for HTTPS, and ExternalDNS for automatic DNS updates. Monitoring is handled with Prometheus and Grafana to ensure visibility and performance tracking. The result is a secure, scalable, and fully automated infrastructure that follows modern DevOps best practices.
 

# Key Features
Amazon EKS: Managed Kubernetes service for running containerized applications at scale with high availability, security, and seamless AWS integration.
ArgoCD: Declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes, enabling automatic application deployment from Git repositories.
Helm Charts: Simplifies the deployment and management of complex Kubernetes applications using reusable, version-controlled charts.
Cert-Manager: Automates the management and issuance of TLS/SSL certificates within Kubernetes, integrated with ACME for automated renewals.
ExternalDNS: Dynamically manages DNS records in AWS Route 53 based on Kubernetes resources, automating DNS record creation and updates.
